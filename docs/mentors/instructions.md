* Run the notebooks and make sure everything runs in your local machine

* Have at least two meetings with the mentors, 2 weeks and 1 day before the workshop. 

## During the workshop

* We will be supporting learning by answering questions and guiding people if they lose track. 
* Questions will vary, from very simple Python issues,to more complex questions about the performance of the code or questions about the algorithms. 
* It is OK to say you don't know the answer of a question. Talk to another mentor who might have an answer.
